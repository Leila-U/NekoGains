Everyone has participated

Our release goal for sprint 1 was for there to be a complete navigation bar, a
complete backend: such as user class, research, and a data-base as well as
a log-in and questionnaire for the sign-in.

Stories for the sprint 1:
THEC-8: As a user I want to be able to login so that I can access my data from any phone
THEC-9: As a user I want to be able to sign-up so that I can have my progress on the cloud
THEC-20: As a user I want to have a UI for my home page so that I can access all menus
THEC-23: As a user I want to see my pet on the main page so that I can check up on them
THEC-24: As a user I want to be able to have personalized workout for me so that I can exercise according to my body's needs
THEC-27: As a user I want to input my height, and weight, so that I can know my BMI changes
