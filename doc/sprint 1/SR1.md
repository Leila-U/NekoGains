UNFINISHED TASKS
As a user I want to be able to access a variety of personalized workouts
As a user I want to be able to register as a new user.
As a user I want to be able to see what workouts I will be doing.

Practices to continue:
  - messaging in discord when git push
  - weekly meetings in person (on Fridays)
  - creating sub-tasks for UserStories
  - handing out tasks in person during meetings

Practices to implement:
  - branching off UserStories instead of dev for subtasks
  - daily reminders for stand-ups in the discord chat
  - implement and enforce git .ignore

Harmful Practices:
  - not branching when doing worked
  - not doing pull requests for dev branch

Best experience:
    The weekly meetings and working together is a very nice experience.

Worst experience:
    Pull requests being confusing, as well as merge conflicts with build folders
    + android studio documentation outdated
