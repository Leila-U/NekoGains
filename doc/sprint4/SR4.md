Sprint 4 retrospective meeting
Participants: Coco Liang, Kana Hashimoto, Jeremy Nguyen, Arthur Sit, Roy Lu, Leila Uy
Everyone has participated.

Unfinished Tasks:
THEC-55: As a user I want my pet to display their thoughts so that they feel more alive
THEC-18: As As a user I want to know when I last worked out so that I can stay informed.
THEC-56: As a user I want to view tutorial pages for workouts so I know how to do them

Practices to continue:
  - messaging in discord when git push/ making a pull request
  - weekly meetings online now (on Fridays)
  - creating sub-tasks for UserStories
  - handing out tasks in person during meetings
  - creating a To Do List during the meetings
  - communicating on discord
  - reminders on doing standups in the discord group
  - doing the standups within 24 hours

Practices to implement:
- better at meeting on time.
- better communication of changes, and additions added to the project.
- better file management.


Harmful Practices:
  - not branching when doing work.
  - not communicating enough on how we are implementing our parts.

Best experience:
- See our project coming together, as its getting closer, and closer to being finished. 

Worst experience:
    Still had issues with GIT, as Android Studio auto-generates/changes files when opening the project.
