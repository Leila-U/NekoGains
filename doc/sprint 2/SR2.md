Sprint 2 retrospective meeting
Participants: Coco Liang, Kana Hashimoto, Jeremy Nguyen, Arthur Sit, Roy Lu, Leila Uy
Everyone has participated

Unfinished Tasks:
As a user I want to have tutorial panels for each workout so that I now how to properly do each one

Practices to continue:
  - messaging in discord when git push/ making a pull request
  - weekly meetings in person (on Fridays)
  - creating sub-tasks for UserStories
  - handing out tasks in person during meetings
  - creating a To Do List during the meetings
  - communicating on discord

Practices to implement:
  - daily reminders for stand-ups in the discord chat
  - implement and fixing git .ignore as Android Studio autocreate files
  - doing the standups within 24 hours

Harmful Practices:
  - not branching when doing worked
  - not doing pull requests for dev branch
  - not communicating enough on how we are implementing our parts

Best experience:
    The weekly meetings and working together is a very nice experience. Doing the tutorial showcase of our application.

Worst experience:
    Pull requests being confusing, as well as merge conflicts with build folders
    + android studio documentation outdated + android studio auto changing files that made git more difficult to use.
