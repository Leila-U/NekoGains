Summary

Objective: Build an exercise application that motivates people through a virtual pet. The application will 
recommend an exercise routine, keep track of calories burned, and prompt the user to continue exercising 
daily through login rewards.

Key Personas:
•	Losing Weight: Adrianna is a second-year university student. Adrianna studies constantly as she 
        enrolled in a highly competitive program and her dream is to graduate as valedictorian. 
•	Build Muscle: Andrew-a 16-year-old high school student and the star of the volleyball team. To 
        his teammates, Andrew is kind, cooperative, and a fantastic spiker.

Key Scenarios:
•	Adrianna wants to lose the weight to put her in a healthy mind and body, but she doesn’t know 
        much about exercising and has very little time to devote to going to the gym. She is interested 
        in an app that will help guide her and is very casual and flexible as her schedule is always 
        changing. Adrianna is used to routines and thinks that an application that rewards dedication 
        would motivate her to keep going.
•	Andrew is currently in good physical shape. To stay fit, his coach suggested that Andrew should 
        exercise outside of training. When working out on his own, Andrew often finds himself bored and 
        thus less motivated to work out. Compared to volleyball training, working out by himself is 
        boring without his friends around him. Andrew is trying to find a way to make working out more 
        entertaining for him.   

Key Principles: User Delight over Knowledge Expertise. The design focuses on consistency, motivation, 
and enjoyment. We want to help users start a healthy lifestyle and motivate them to maintain it.
